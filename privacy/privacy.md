## Personal Data Bins Collects From You

* When you enter your address during setup, Bins uses Apple’s geocoding services to show auto-complete suggestions and to determine your coordinates. If you share your current location instead, Bins uses the coordinates provided by the system. Neither your address nor your location data are sent to our servers.

* When Bins communicates with our servers (e.g., to download configuration settings), basic details—like your IP address and app version—are sent. While this data is not permanently stored on our servers, it may be retained by third-party providers as it passes through our infrastructure. Wherever possible, we de-identify this information.

## Third-Party Services Used by Bins

* **[Apple](https://apple.com/ca)** provides the geocoding services described above. When [“Share iPhone & Watch Analytics”](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT202100) is enabled in the Settings app, Apple also provides anonymized crash data and statistics.
* **[Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)** provides infrastructure services (e.g., caching, SSL certificates, DDoS protection) for our backend systems.

* **[FastMail](https://fastmail.com)** provides email hosting for customer support emails.
