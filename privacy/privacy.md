# Privacy Policy

## Setting Up Bins

* When you enter your address during setup, Bins uses Apple&rsquo;s geocoding services to show auto-complete suggestions and to determine your coordinates. If you share your current location instead, Bins uses the coordinates provided by the system. Neither your address nor your location data are sent to our servers.

## Communication With Our Servers

* Bins periodically downloads configuration settings from our servers.
* All requests send basic technical information to our servers, including your IP address, device model, operating system version, and app version. We do not store this data permanently, but it may be retained in our server logs temporarily or by third-party providers as it passes through our infrastructure. As a precaution, our logs only record a pseudonymized version of your IP address.
* All communications with our servers are encrypted using HTTPS.

## Third-Party Services

* **[Apple](https://apple.com/ca)** provides the geocoding services described above. When [&ldquo;Share iPhone & Watch Analytics&rdquo;](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT202100) is enabled in the Settings app, Apple also provides anonymized crash data and statistics.
* **[Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)** provides infrastructure services (e.g., caching, SSL certificates, DDoS protection) for our backend systems.
* **[DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com)** provides the servers that host our backend systems.
* **[FastMail](https://fastmail.com)** provides email hosting for customer support emails.
* **[New Relic](https://newrelic.com)** provides application performance monitoring for our backend systems.
