# Privacy Policy

## Overview

To respect your right to privacy, Bins only asks you to provide your personal information when the app absolutely needs the information to function.

Your personal information can not be accessed by the app’s developer and is only shared with third parties for the purposes described in the “Third Parties and Your Personal Information” section below.

Bins does not sell your personal information to third parties.

## Bins and Your Personal Information

*   When launched for the first time, Bins asks for either your address or your current location so that the app can find the recycling schedule for where you live.

    If you provide your address by typing it into the app’s search bar, Bins will send what you’re typing to Apple to show you auto-complete suggestions and to convert your address into coordinates. If you provide the app with your current location, this step is skipped because iOS reports location data as coordinates.

*   Using these coordinates, Bins checks its database for matching schedule information. Since the database is included with the app when it is submitted to the App Store, Bins searches its database without communicating with any servers and without any of your personal information leaving your device.

## Third Parties and Your Personal Information

* If you provide your address by typing it into the app’s search bar, Bins will send what you’re typing to [Apple](https://apple.com/ca) to show you auto-complete suggestions and to convert your address into coordinates.

* If you have chosen to share anonymous information with app developers through Apple, Apple may provide the developer of Bins with crash data and statistics about how you use the app. To learn more about anonymous crash data and statistics on iOS or how to opt out, visit [Apple’s support website](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT202100).

* When you email the developer of Bins for support, these communications are routed through an email address provided by [Hover](https://hover.com) and stored indefinitely with [FastMail](https://fastmail.com). You can request to have these communications deleted by contacting <support@usebins.com>.

* Bins does not use any third-party services for analytics or crash reporting.
